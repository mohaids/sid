It was early September, when I reached out to Professor Yener expressing my interest to be involved in security research. Now, a few months into this RCA research, I'm glad through happenstance I reached out.

# Objective
Given a binary, is it possible to create a RCA (Root Cause Analysis) of a binary, given a PoC (Proof of Concept)

# Necessary Background Definitions
First, what does RCA even mean? RCA, also known as Root Cause Analysis, is a consise report of why a system encountered an issue. In this research, the system will be a binary, and the issue will be a crash triggered by a PoC. This PoC will be either static, in the form of a `.poc` file, or it'll be dynamic, in form of a `.py` file. Ideally, for a closed-loop, better system,
