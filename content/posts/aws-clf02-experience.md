# Introduction
Just a few hours ago did I see the ending screen congratulating me with a much awaited word: "PASS". I still haven't seen the status of my passing reflected on my AWS Account, nor have I recieved an email - but I am told it will take until 5 days. This post is to hopefully be yet another small stepping stone towards other certiciations such as Network+ and HTB's CPTS certification.
# What is AWS CLF-02?
Foremost, I question that has been bugging me, and probably has bugging you as well is, why is the exam called "Certified Cloud Practioner", but is abbreviated as "CLF" - which apparently means "Certified Level Foundation". But it will remain "CCP" to me.

Anyways, this exam is truly a foundational exam that introduces potential certificate holders to a wide array of AWS Services and some of their interactions with each other (on a high level).

# My Experience
The amount of time I spent per day wildly varied, sometimes I would spend about 3 hours per day, other days it would be about 6 hours. I did the bulk of my studying during Winter Break (~ 2 weeks üò≠), but was vaguely aware of some services from prior knowledge gathering. 

### Resources
I'm going to echo the same sentiments on numerous other forums, which is that Stephane Maarek videos and practices exams are the best, along with Tutorial Dojo's materials. While I didn't spend a significant amount of time on Maarek's videos, I can confidently vouch that his practice exams are pretty goated.
# Takeaways
This certainly was a decent exam that motivated me to learn about AWS' offerings. Because of this, I would like to actually get my hands dirty by playing around with AWS resources, now that I know what most of them are. Specifically, I do want to explore Infrastructure as Code (IaC) services in particular.
