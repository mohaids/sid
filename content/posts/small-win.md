# Introduction
It was October 28th when I pitched the idea of having a event's calendar page to my favorite RPI admin - Jackie Balcerak.

Objective: I literally just needed one place that would hold all the events happening at Lally. There was this one particular week that so many things were happening I was so confused. It was particularly busy such that Jackie had to send an email detailing everythiing.

# Timeline
10/28 - Jackie put me in contact with Lynda

11/6 - Talked with Lynda + Kyle abt my idea

11/18 - Showed Lynda + Emilee + Kyle my widget mockup and explained how the integration would work, as well as some limitations

../.. - Actually being hosted on [lally.rpi.edu](https://lally.rpi.edu/)

# Technologies Used
This wasn't too technical in nature. Lally's website uses Drupal, and I was recommended that instead of building a solution from the group up, [elfsight.com](https://www.elfsight.com) has widgets to solve this. So I began exploring.

I eventually found a widget I thought wasn't bad, connected it to my alt Google Calendar, populated events, and saw it reflected in the widget. Experimented with photos in the events, and found it to look good.

# Take-away
While this project wasn't particularly technical, the key idea is talking about your ideas to your champions and explaining your thought process behind them.

Once again, I couldn't have done this without Jackie connecting me to the right people.
