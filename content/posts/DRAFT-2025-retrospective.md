# Introduction


# Milestones

### AWS Certifications
I've acheived 2 AWS certifications so far. I got the AWS Cloud Practioner on January 11th, and later I got AWS Certified Solutions Architect (Associate), in the summer, on August 8th. 

I intend to get my AWS Security Specialty sometime next year, hopefully in February.
