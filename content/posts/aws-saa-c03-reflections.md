# Introduction
I'm him. 

During the exam, I felt becoming more dreadful as I saw more questions because I couldn't pick an answer immedeately and at best could only eliminate one option. I wrote down all the question numbers on the scratch piece of paper I was given and decided to track what opinions I had of each set of options for all 65 questions.

This system definetely helped me pass the exam because I didn't have to remember what options I felt could not be correct. 

# My Experience
I already knew a lot of the services from my previous AWS Certified Cloud Practioner (CLF-C02) exam and from my own dabbling with AWS services (such as EC2, ECS, Secrets Manager, etc.) while building my [discrete instagram bot](https://github.com/mohaids/instagram-to-discord-notifier).

Even though I had this knowledge, I felt it would be useful to formally certify this knowledge via this exam. So for the past 2 weeks or so, everyday I spent at least a couple hours going through Stephane Maarek's course + practice exams as well as Tutorial Dojo's Practice Test material.

Shout out to the users on [r/awscertifications](https://www.reddit.com/r/AWSCertifications/) for posting about their success stories and thus giving me the motivation for studying.

# Takeaways
Solid exam, really tested my AWS knowledge thoroughly. 

- The exam *will* test your depth. Knowing what a service is isn't enough — you need to understand when and *why* you’d use one over another.
- Don’t cram like I did. Two intense weeks worked for me, but it was high-stress. If I could do it over, I’d spread it out more.
- Track your progress during the exam. My scratch-paper tracking method helped reduce panic and focus on logic over memory.

If you're thinking about taking this exam - go for it. Whether you're deep in security or just getting into cloud, the SAA cert forces you to *actually think* through cloud architecture. And that’s what makes it valuable.
