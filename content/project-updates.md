### 6.21
Review of current status of the project: 
- The technical implementation works - however since I have a lot of VMs on at the moment, I have no clue which one hosts the working implementation.
    - [ ] Action Item: Clean up VMs and ensure only one stable machine remains

- There has been some scope creep with trying to use Terraform + CloudFormation as methods to use to set up this project
    - [ ] Action Item: Delay this for a bit

- Immedeate items that need to be addressed are:
    - [ ] The need to clean up documentation
    - [ ] Clean up the main readme (read: go through your checkboxes and organize them)
    - [ ] also note that need to not use the raspberry pi ("earlier in the project i was convinced that a raspberry pi was needed to get around being blocked by services, ...")
        - [ ] probably should create a new diagram without the pi
